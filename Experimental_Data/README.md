Experimental Data
=================

This repository contains all relevant experimental data associated with the
paper *"Toggle-like current-induced Bloch point dynamics of 3D skyrmion
strings in a room temperature nanowire"*, by M. T. Birch, D. Cortes-Ortuno, K.
Litzius, S. Wintz, F. Schulz, M. Weigand, A. Štefančič, D. A. Mayoh, G.
Balakrishnan, P. D. Hatton, G. Schuetz.

The main folder contains jupyter python notebooks which analyse and plot all
main and extended data figure panels from the experimental data.


**Figure_Panels** - All output `.png` files of the python notebooks, labelled
either as main figure or extended data figure panels.

**Magnetometry_Data** - Data files from the MPMS3 VSM magnetometer, acquired by
measuring the bulk single Co8Zn9Mn3 crystal. The folder contains both MvT and
AC susceptibility vs H data.

**Plotting_Sim_Data** - A couple of data files from the simulations associated
with the plots in main Fig 3.

**Pulse_Temp_data** - Data files utilised in the temperature-resistance
determination from electrical pulse measurements. `Pulse_Analysis` contains the
output files extracting the input, output and reflected amplitudes of hundreds
of pulses of different input voltages. `Pulse_Traces` contains examples of 4
different input and output pulse measurements. `TvR_Callibration.csv` contains
data associated with the T vs R calibration performed on a hot plate.

**SEM_Data** - Scanning electron microscopy images of the Co8Zn9Mn3 nanowire
fabrication process, performed using a Focused Ion Beam system.

**Spectra_Data** - Files associated with the XMCD spectrum measured using the
Co8Zn9Mn3 nanowire sample.

**STXM_Data** - Contains all raw data and processed image files of the STXM
experiment. Sub folders contain datasets associated with different measurement
experiments, as explained by the file within the main folder.
